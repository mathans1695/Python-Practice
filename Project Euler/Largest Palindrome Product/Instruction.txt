Problem Statement from Project Euler:
	Thought Process:
		Three digits number starts from 100 and ends with 999. Use two for loop and find the product of every combination of two three digits multiples. 
		Check whether it's a palindrome by separating and combining the number. After combining, check if both numbers are same
		
	Algorithm:
		1. Use two for loop, and it should starts its iteration from 999 and ends with 100, because this will take iteration.
			for i in range(999, 99, -1):
				for j in range(999, 99, -1):
					product = i * j
					copy = product
					while copy != 0:
						reverse += copy % 10
						copy //= 10
					if product == reverse:
						print(product)
